            Episode 1: Delivery

            You wake up, ready for another normal day of
            your normal life in your normal little village.



            Hello, says an uncanny little voice in your head
            that just might be your own voice.
            It's time to start exploring. If you're ever unsure what
            to do, type "hint" and I'll offer you some directions. I have
            lots of good advice, so don't be afraid to ask, or even to
            keep pestering me for help if my first (or second) piece of
            advice just isn't enough.

            Let's get started!

                    with the embossed image of a 
                    narrow, yellow eye. You're pretty sure that's not
                    something you would have ordered,
                    but maybe your decorative medallion tastes changed
                    drastically in the past week.

                shaped like a head of
                fresh cabbage falls into your lap.
                Perfect. How could you have forgotten about ordering
                this? Just looking at it makes
                you want to drink tea, so you search the bottom of the
                package for some teabags. Nothing.
                Apparently you ordered a teapot
                but no tea. Good job, you.

            Your kitchen looks exceptionally clean today. 
            Last night you remembered to put all of the
            perishable food back in the refrigerator
            that's in the corner of the room, so it 
            smells better than usual as well. You only
            have half of the pantry spread out across the counters 
            in an elaborate pyramid of food, and
            these are the food items that are convenient to have 
            right beside you. Well, most of them.
            The stove only has three major stains, and two of them are
            never coming off, so it's not fair
            to count those. The sink might be overflowing with dishes,
            but you still have one or two clean plates,
            and who needs more than that?

            The kitchen exits into the living room.

            Cleaning the entire kitchen is way too imposing

        A couch with two cushions. It's called a loveseat by 
        some people, which you suppose is an accurate name 
        because you really love to sit on this seat, eating 
        snacks and watching TV all by yourself. The dark gap

        Your typical QWERTY keyboard, except the Q is missing, 
        so it's more of a WERTY keyboard. Q is a pretty

        to living creatures.
    }
    object tv {
        The football game isn't on for another three hours.
        You're pretty sure your television is as disappointed
        by the wait as you are.

                    the part that you have enough gasoline to get to,
                    and that isn't on another continent. It's a shame
                    you're so single minded about getting to the post
                    office. 

                    You drive through the normal streets of your normal
                    town. The sky is bleak and threatening snow again.
                    Each house you pass looks somewhat like the one
                    before it, windows spilling orange light out onto
                    snowcovered yards. There must be happy, well 
                    adjusted people inside of all of those houses. 
                    They are probably having the grandest time, 
                    without you.

                    What a peaceful, ordinary town. You can't believe
                    how boring it is here.

                    You pull into the post office parking lot. The 
                    sound of snow crunching under your tires is 
                    extremely satisfying to you, and you consider 
                    backing up and driving forward several more times.
                    This is of course stupid, as so many of your 
                    ideas are. You park and get out of the car, then
                    enter the post office.

            It's understandable how the package could have
            been delivered to the wrong address, given the 
            awful city planning that went on during Rockburg 
            early years. Matthias Matusiak, Rockburg's founder,
            did many great things, but creating an avenue with two
            of every street number, only differentiable 
            by use of 'E' or 'W', was somewhat asinine. You 
            would also have preferred the avenue not have
            a difficult to pronounce Polish name. 

            You always forget how small Rockburg is. 
            Actually, you have no idea what size Rockburg is.
            The point is, you are at the address, and it didn't
            seem to take that long to get there. You get 
            out of the car and walk to the doorstep of the 
            intended package recipient's home.

            of twisted wires and flickering lights. At last,

            upon the corpses of its brethren. It paws at the
            twisted wires for a moment before trotting back to
            its position in the now vacant ring of deer. As
            if summoned, the wires untangle themselves and
            reassemble into the remaining herd. The deer resume
            their positions and the entire scene appears completely
            unchanged. Even the freshly fallen snow bears no markings
            of a scuffle ever occurring. Your sense of stupefaction

        You don't know much about art history, but this painting

        It's a portrait. Of a chair. It's the spitting image of the

        the chair in the painting is wreathed in flames. You know,
        just really on fire. The real chair isn't on fire at all.
        That's a quality you like in a chair, not being on fire.

        Leaves of Grass, some weird fantasy series, and a collection
        of every Kurt Vonnegut novel in existence. The bottom shelf
        has some books in another language, and all of the Claire

            but there's an odd painting on the wall. There's a nice,
            empty spot at the side of the room that looks like
            the perfect place to add an armchair with a maroon
            teapot pattern. But, sadly, there is no armchair, only
            an elaborate scorch mark where the armchair should go.
            The sofa still looks pretty nice, though.
            The decor is rather minimal, with some sort of rock
            collection hung in a pigeonholed box on the wall,

            a lot of things have been reminding you of fiery death
            lately.

            There's the cat again! You can see it through the doorway.
            It stares unblinking at you, and you feel a little unnerved.

            This room looks like its been through some hard times,
            where those hard times may or may not have involved
            copious amounts of fire. The odd painting on the wall
            looks unharmed, though. There's a nice, empty spot
            at the side of the room that looks like the perfect
            place to add an armchair with a maroon teapot pattern.
            But, sadly, there is no armchair, only an elaborate scorch
            mark where the armchair should go. 
            The sofa still looks pretty nice, though.
            The decor is rather
            minimal, with some sort of rock collection hung
            in a pigeonholed box on the wall, and bookshelf
            tucked in the corners. There is also a metal filing
            cabinet that looks like it once may have been very secure.
            Now, however, the metal has been warped and contorted as
            if by some intense heat.
